# Kamatimer
###### *Kamatis* is Filipino for tomato.

My goal for this project is to create a simple web app for a pomodoro timer that suits my own needs in hopes of being just a bit more productive. Will consider making into a Chrome extension after initial implementation.

### Basic Features
- Variable timer limit for work sessions (25, 30, 45 minutes)
- 5 minute breaks initiated after every work session
- Every four work sessions, prompt for a break of variable time limit (15, 20, 30 minutes)
- Option to end session early

### Feature Wishlist
- Prompt for to-do list before first session
- Ability to mark off of to-do list or comment on what was done after each work session
- Option to save sessions locally (perhaps .txt file)
