# Kamatimer
###### *Kamatis* is Filipino for tomato.

My goal for this project is to create a simple web app for a pomodoro timer that suits my own needs in hopes of being just a bit more productive.

- Variable timer limit for work sessions (25, 30, 45 minutes)
- 5-minute breaks after every work session
- Every four work sessions, prompt for a break of variable time limit (15, 20, 30 minutes dependent on duration of preceding work session)
